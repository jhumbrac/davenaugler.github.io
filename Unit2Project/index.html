		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="http://www.express.com/" target="_blank">Express.com</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Lynda.com</a></li>
			</ol>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>

			<p>Lynda makes great use of the positive and negative space on their website. Links, images, and text are sized approprietly so that your eye's naturally scroll down the site. Express takes their positive space and shows you what they can offer you through images, video, and enticing call to actions.</p>

			<p>Express could come back to their site and readdress the size of their text on the title bar. Lynda could productivley use more of the negative space on the screen. 

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

			<p>These two websites are easy to navigate as well as simple to understand what to do once you get to their website. Both sites offer an obvious title and navigational bar at the top of the site while allowing the space below give directions or insentives to go deeper into the website.</p>

			<p>Each site engages people differently. Express is a clothing company that will sell their merchandise by using large images and short descriptions. Lynda will offer a large video window with a detailed description of each course.</p>

			<dd><p>This is an example of what my Projects page would look like. Small image with a description of what each project is. You would click on an image and it would take you to another page within the site showing an enlarged version of the small image and what I did to create that project.</dd></p>
