		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I'm a Web Design and Development student, living in Boise, ID. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development becuase my cousin dazzled me with a project him and his team were working on in Seattle. And BAM! I was hooked.</p>

		<h2><u>My Mission</u></h2>

		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a web developer that can code the front-end as well as the back-end of web sites with Drake Cooper Advertising Agency, because I like to work with other individuals that are constantly moving forward and influencing those around them.</p>
